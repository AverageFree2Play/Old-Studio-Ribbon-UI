# Old-Studio-Ribbon-UI
These are custom Next Gen Studio ribbon UI tabs designed to look like the original ribbon tab prior to the forced next gen studio ui update.

This is a fork of TenebrisNoctua's OldRibbonTabs: https://github.com/TenebrisNoctua/RibbonTools/tree/main/OldRibbonTabs

# Installation
1. Locate your CustomRibbonTabs folder. It should be in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Roblox\<user-id>\CustomRibbonTabs`. If you're on MacOS: `~/Documents/Roblox/<userID>/CustomRibbonTabs`
2. Download the json files in the `CustomRibbonTabs` folder from the repository and drop all (or the ones you would like) .json file(s) inside your `CustomRibbonTabs` folder.
3. Reload the custom tabs through the Manage Tabs menu, and they should all appear. After that, you can reorder or disable some of them if you wish.

# Note
This is based of the Dec 11 build of Roblox Studio. With the FFlag: `FFlagEnableRibbonPlugin3` still functional.
This is not 100% guranteed accurate. As some features are left undocumented or missing. However, I did try my best at replicating.
